# Miva-Admin-Tweaks-Chrome-Extension
Fixing some minor usability annoyances in the Miva admin with a chrome extension that runs when it detects admin.mvc in your URL.

To add to chrome: navigate to chrome://extensions in Chrome browser, check the developer mode box, select load unpacked extension, navigate and select the dist folder from this repository that you downloaded. I intend to package and release to chrome extension library once we get some more tweaks added.
